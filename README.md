## Configuration

### Umbraco Configuration

In order for the MCP to talk to the Management API you will need to create a API user
if you are unsure how to do this follow [Umbraco's documentation](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/data/users/api-users).

The level of access you provider this user will determine what your agent is able to do.
